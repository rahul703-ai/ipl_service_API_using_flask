## Features

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathered IPL match data, cleaned it, and prepared it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered trends and insights from the data, such as top-performing players and teams.
- **API Development**: Created secure and efficient Flask APIs to provide easy access to the analyzed data.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: SQL (optional for storing data)
- **API Testing**: Postman

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-data-analysis-api.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ipl-data-analysis-api
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set Up the Database** (Optional):
   If you are using a database, set it up and configure the connection in the Flask app.

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask Server**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
2. **Access the APIs**:
   Use tools like Postman or a web browser to interact with the APIs.
